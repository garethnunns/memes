<h2 id="logging-in">Logging in</h2>

<p>Here you can see the username and password field. If you already have an account please enter your username into the user name field and your password into the password field like below </p>

<p>[logging in screen]</p>

<p>Once you have entered your username and password, press “Sign In”</p>

<p>If successful then you will be taken to the meme feed</p>

<p>[successful]</p>

<p>However if you are not successful then you will need to try your username and password again or failing that, changing them.</p>

<p>[unsuccessful]</p>

<h2 id="memes">Memes</h2>

<p>When you come across your first meme you will have several options. The first option is the ability to read comments from other users about the meme. When you scroll down below the meme you can see the comment and the person who commented in the order it was written.</p>

<p>[comment bit]</p>

<p>You then also have the option to star a meme. When you star a meme it will let the user who posted the meme that their meme is an appreciated meme. That meme is then saved in your “Starred Memes”, this is a section where all your favourite memes appear. </p>

<p>Another option that you have is the ability to repost a meme. This is more useful when you start to gain more followers as it allows you to share quality memes with your followers. When you press repost it appears on your profile alongside other memes that you have posted. </p>

<p>[repost meme]</p>

<p>When you press ‘repost’ you will have the chance to add a caption which gives you the opportunity to add your own stance on the meme.</p>

<p>[caption]</p>

<p>Then it will be posted on the feed below</p>

<h2 id="meme-feed">Meme Feed</h2>

<p>Once you have successfully logged in you will be come across a screen called feed. Once you start a new account you will automatically follow our resident Meme Lord, Gareth Nunns. The feed is where you will see all the memes of the people you follow. The memes are ordered in a way that allows the most recent meme to be at the top of the feed. </p>

<p>[meme feed start]</p>

<p>Scroll up with your finger and more memes will appear </p>

<h2 id="hot-feed">Hot Feed</h2>

<p>This is where you will find most of your favourite memes and it is where it is easy to follow accounts that have very good memes. The higher up the list that the meme is, the “Hotter” the meme is.  The hotter the meme the more popular the meme is. </p>



<h2 id="add-memes">Add Memes</h2>

<p>Once you have gotten to grips with appreciating other memes, you can get around to adding your own funny memes. To add a meme you need to press the + button which will take you to your devices file manager. </p>

<p>[plus button]</p>

<p>File explorers may be different based on what device you use but the general idea is that you find your meme and select it.</p>

<p>[selected meme]</p>

<p>Once you have selected the meme you want to upload, you will be able to add a caption to give the meme context</p>

<p>[caption]</p>

<p>Press post and if the meme fits the criteria the meme will be posted to your profile</p>

<p>[successful]</p>

<p>If the post doesn’t pass the criteria of Memestagram then it will show a message telling the user that the image is wrong</p>

<p>[unsuccessful]</p>
